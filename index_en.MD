## What is DripLog?
DripLog is an app created by nurses to centrally manage drip rate calculations, infusion histories, and records.  
It offers the following features:

- **Drip rate calculation & drop timing notifications**  
  Based on the entered infusion volume, infusion duration, and type of infusion set (adult, pediatric, gastrostomy, or custom setting), the app calculates the rate and notifies you of the drop timing with vibration and sound.  
  This allows you to adjust without watching the second hand.

- **Check the drip rate during infusion**  
  While infusion is ongoing, you can measure the current drip rate by tapping the button five times in rhythm with the drops in the drip chamber.

- **End time notifications**  
  The app notifies you at two points: the scheduled end time and a selected time before it (5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes).

- **Logging function**  
  Results from initial drip rate calculations and ongoing infusion checks are automatically saved.  
  You can also enter certain observation items such as insertion site.  
  When documenting, you can refer to the log, reducing the effort needed to recall details.

- **Automatic infusion record creation**  
  The calculated drip rate and any entered observation items are combined to automatically create an infusion record.  
  The generated record is copied to the clipboard, ready to be pasted into electronic medical record apps or browsers.
